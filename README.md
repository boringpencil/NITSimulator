this code intends to simulate the effects of a negative income tax if implemented in the United States 
the data used (the relevent aspects being the household income level at each percentile in 2021) comes from: https://dqydj.com/average-median-top-household-income-percentiles/
this code should by no means be used as an end all, be all for the costs of a NIT. It is based off of rough estimates, so take with a grain of salt
